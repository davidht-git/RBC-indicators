#This project aims to review key macro-economic variables that affect the business cycle. It is broken down into two r scripts that leverage different data with the first script utilizing fred quarterly data. The data was #downloaded as CSV files and then imported to utilize. The second script utilizes a csv compiled by compustat to review variables on a firm level.

#This project is fairly basic but involves cleaning up data and then using first differences to detrend macro variables and then plotting correlations for them. 

#The project helped me learn how to detrend macro data in R as well as give me a broader understanding of understanding macro data as well as cleaning up large scale data with many observations and be able to produce readable #and help graphs/charts for analysis of them.
